    "[Airbnb](https://airbnb.com/) is a popular platform for hosts to accommodate guests with short-term stays and leisure activities. It was born in 2008 when the two founders welcomed three guests to their San Francisco home. Airbnb has grown to serve 4 million hosts in about 100,000 cities. That makes Airbnb's valuation worth more than top three hotel chains combined as of December 2020 ([source](https://www.businessinsider.com/airbnb-ipo-valuation-tops-three-hotel-chains-combined-opening-day-2020-12)).\n",

    "### ⚔️ Your goal\n",
    "\n",
    "You have recently joined a property management firm as a business development manager. Your role is to establish and deepen relationships with property owners. Your success on building relationships largely depends on the firm's ability to offer value-adding services to the property owners.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common concern that most property owners face is dealing with vacant properties. The traditional approach to to fill up vacant properties is to run paid advertisements or to provide sign-up incentives (e.g., free rent for a month if leased for 13+ months, gift cards, referral bonus, free parking). You have a better idea - why not convert some of the vacant properties into vacation rentals?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case study, you'll use SQL analyze all Airbnb listings in the city your firm is operating in. Below are some of the questions you'll be answering.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 👉 Are there properties that can accommodate more than 8 guests?\n",
    "- 👉 Are there properties that target guests staying over a month?\n",
    "- 👉 Are there properties that have more than 5 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms?\n",
    "- 👉 What are the average price, occupancy (availability), and review score by room type?\n",
    "- 👉 Can you calculate the metrics of interest (number of listings, average price, average occupancy, average review score) by the number of bedrooms?\n",
    "- 👉 How about by neighbourhoods? Can you also find the average property dimensions (number of bedrooms & bathrooms)?\n",
    "- 👉 How do the metrics and dimensions differ between superhost and non-superhost listings?\n",
    "- 👉 Can you find all listings that were never booked?\n",
    "- 👉 Can you find the top 15 highest-rated listings?\n",
    "- 👉 Can you find listings with the keyword \"bright\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that looking at *just* the listings data is not sufficient to determine whether converting a vacant property to an Airbnb listing is a good idea. The analysis you perform here is preliminary. If you'd like, you can download additional booking data at [http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) to go further on your own."

    "- ✔️ This time, you will repeat the previous analysis using `is_superhost` instead of `neighbourhood`.\n",
    "- ✔️ Using the `listings` table, find the following measures by the host status (`is_superhost`):\n",
    "    - Count of rows (number of listings)\n",
    "    - Average number of `bedrooms`\n",
    "    - Average number of `bathrooms`\n",
    "    - Average number of maximum guests (average of `accommodates`)\n",
    "    - Average `price`\n",
    "    - Average `availability_365`\n",
    "    - Average `review_score`\n",
    "- ✔️ Store your query to a new variable named `query_details_by_host_status`.\n",
    "- ✔️ The result of your query should have the following 8 columns (in the same order):\n",
    "    - `is_superhost`\n",
    "    - `num_listings`\n",
    "    - `avg_bedrooms`,\n",
    "    - `avg_bathrooms`,\n",
    "    - `avg_accommodates`,\n",
    "    - `avg_price`\n",
    "    - `avg_availability`\n",
