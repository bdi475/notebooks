The three most important concepts are embedded in the name itself.\n","\n","1. **Structured**: The data is structured. You work with *fixed* fields.\n","2. **Query**: You request information using a text query.\n","3. **Language**: Guess what, SQL is another programming language!\n","\n","If Python was your first programming language, you can now brag about your second programming language. üòé"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["---\n","\n","### ‚ùì Why use SQL? Can't we use Python (Pandas)? üêº\n","\n","Using Pandas can be easier in many cases unless you're familiar with SQL. Many data science professionals will agree that Pandas is a more human-friendly method ([discussion here](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/34357/why-do-people-prefer-pandas-to-sql)). You can perform the most common operations in SQL with Pandas ([comparison with SQL here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/comparison/comparison_with_sql.html)).\n","\n","![Kevin](https://github.com/bdi475/images/blob/main/lecture-notes/sql/kevin-malone-pandas-sql.jpg?raw=true)\n","\n","Huh? When are you supposed to use SQL then? ü§® You should use SQL when you have a large source of data on a remote location. Pandas works great... until you run out of memory (RAM). When you read data from a source, Pandas loads the entire data into memory by default. Pandas will fail if your data is too large.\n","\n","Instead of loading all data into memory first, you can query a database system and retrieve only the information you need. This is almost always faster and more efficient."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["---\n","\n","## ‚ö°Ô∏è Database Management Systems (DBMS)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["A database is a collection of data. A database management system is a software used to let users communicate with a database. There are many types of DBMS software. We will only cover relational database management systems (RDBMS). Many popular RDBMS exist, such as:\n","\n","- PostgreSQL\n","- Oracle Database\n","- MySQL\n","- MariaDB (fork of MySQL)\n","- SQLite\n","\n","We will use [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/), since it is the easiest one to set up."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["---\n","\n","### ‚ùì Why use databases? Can't we use CSV files?\n","\n","This discussion is somewhat similar to why we use SQL instead of Pandas. Relational database management systems have existed since the 1970s. They are highly optimized even when your data size is humongous. Of course, the performance is dependent on the *query* you write even if you use an RDBMS.\n","\n","![Boardroom
