These rideshare companies are required to routinely report vehicles, drivers, and trips information to the City of Chicago, which are published to the [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/). The latest trips dataset can be downloaded at [this page](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Transportation-Network-Providers-Trips/m6dm-c72p).\n","\n","### 🐢 Your dataset\n","\n","- The original dataset contains information about 170 million ridesharing trips between 2018 and 2021. That translates to over 40GB of raw data. 🙀☠️🙀\n","- **Approximately 1% of the original data has been randomly sampled**, preprocessed, and compressed.\n","- Only 2019 and 2020 data have been selected.\n","\n","### ⚔️ Your goal\n","\n","Analyze the dataset and answer the following questions:\n","\n","- 👉 How has the COVID-19 affected the total number of trips in 2019 and 2020?\n","- 👉 How has the COVID-19 affected the number of monthly trips?\n","- 👉 Have passengers become more generous or frugal when tipping during the pandemic?\n","- 👉 What were the trip dimensions (trip duration, distance, and fare) of rides taken place right before the July 4th fireworks in 2019 and 2020?\n","- 👉 Are passengers pooling rides during the pandemic?\n","- 👉 What are the top 20 pickup areas (by volume)?\n","- 👉 What are the average trip total for each of the top 20 pickup area?\n","- 👉 Is there any area that has a unusally large trip total?"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"DiznwS2xem7h"},"source":["---\n","\n","▶️ Run the code cell below to import `unittest`, a module used for **🧭 Check Your Work** sections and the
